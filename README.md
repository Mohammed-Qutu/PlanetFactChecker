# PlanetFactChecker

## Description
This Java program generates a random fact about a planet in our solar system, which may or may not be true. The user is prompted to guess if the fact is correct, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess was correct or incorrect. It demonstrates the use of conditionals, random number generation, and user input handling.
